## 🔬 The Quantum Threat

Current encryption methods protecting digital data worldwide will be rendered obsolete by quantum computers. SWTCH addresses this existential threat by providing:

- **Immediate Protection**: 19 different post-quantum algorithms
- **Universal Coverage**: All digital content types (text, media, documents)
- **Identity Security**: Quantum-resistant digital signatures with SPHINCS+
- **Economic Sustainability**: Merit-based tokenomics with automatic price discovery

## 🔬 Technical Breakthroughs

### 🔐 Behavioral Cryptography Innovation
SWTCH introduces the world's first **distributed confidence recovery protocol** that transforms authentic user behavior into cryptographic keys. Through continuous network participation—including storage contribution, compute sharing, and service provision—users build immutable behavioral fingerprints that serve as both identity proof and recovery mechanisms, eliminating the need for traditional social recovery trustees.

### 🔐 Encryption Infrastructure
- **Kyber (512/768/1024)** - Key Encapsulation Mechanism  
- **NTRU Prime** - Lattice-based cryptography
- **FrodoKEM** - Learning with Errors
- **ClassicMcEliece** - Code-based cryptography
- **BIKE (L1/L3/L5)** - Optimized code-based encryption

## 🏆 Platform Highlights

### 🆔 Identity Foundation
- **W3C-Compliant DIDs** with quantum-resistant extensions
- **Multi-Chain Anchoring** across major blockchain networks
- **Verifiable Credentials** with post-quantum security
- **Advanced Key Rotation** without identity continuity loss

### 📊 Economic Innovation
- **Total Supply**: 1.2 billion SWTCH tokens
- **Distribution**: 30% pre-allocation, 70% network earned
- **Bonding Curve**: `P = k * [1 / (1 + e^(-a * (U - 0.5)))]`
- **Fee Structure**: 3% provider + 1% protocol fees
