# SWTCH WhitePaper

## Introduction
#### Purpose
SWTCH proposes a comprehensive quantum-resistant foundation that provides secure infrastructure for digital interactions in the post-quantum era. By combining quantum-resistant Decentralized Identity (DID) with universal quantum-resistant encryption/decryption capabilities, SWTCH creates a foundational platform that secures all forms of digital data and communications. The platform implements SPHINCS+ quantum-resistant signatures, 19 different quantum-resistant encryption algorithms, and comprehensive verifiable credentials systems to enable secure decentralized applications including messaging, storage, AI agents, and autonomous services.
